Segmenter Descriptions

The first segmenter used was the NLTK Punkt segmenter. This is a segmenter based on a list of language abbreviation, collocations,
and words that commonly start sentences. It is trained on a large dataset using an unsupervised learning algorithm.

The second segmenter is a simple rule-based method. It checks whether a character is a sentence ending punctuation marker. If it is
and the marker is followed by an uppercase letter then it segments the sentence.


Results:

Looking at the first 50 lines it seems that the upperCase segmenter is working better than the Punkt segmenter. The reason for this
seems to be that the Punkt segmenter is splitting sentences into new lines when there is some or any kind of abbreviation.
Although this could make sense since the segmenter is trained on English rather than Inupiak. But it still seems to be a problem
when the abbreviations are the kind used in English such as "lb."
